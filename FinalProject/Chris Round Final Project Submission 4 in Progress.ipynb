    "- **Requirements:**\n",
    "   * Review the data set and project with an EIR during office hours.\n",
    "* Practice importing (potentially unformatted) data into clean matrices|data frames, and if necessary, export into a form that makes sense (text files or a database, for example).\n",
    "   * Explore the mathematical properties and visualize data through a python visualization tool (matplotlib and seaborn)\n",
    "* Provide insight about the data set and any impact on a hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Detailed Breakdown:**\n",
    "   * A well organized IPython notebook with code and output\n",
    " * At least one visual for each independent variable and, if possible, its relationship to your dependent variable.\n",
    "      * It's just as important to show what's not correlated as it is to show any actual correlations found.\n",
    "      * Visuals should be well labeled and intuitive based on the data types.\n",
    "        * For example, if your X variable is temperature and Y is \"did it rain,\" a reasonable visual would be two histograms of temperature, one where it rained, and one where it didn't.\n",
    "     * Tables are a perfectly valid visualization tool! Interweave them into your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bonus:**\n",
    "   - Share your analysis online. Jupyter makes this very simple and the setup should not take long.\n",
    " - Version control your code using Git and share your GitHub repo.\n",
    "   - Try experimenting with other visualization languages; python/pandas-highcharts, plotly, \n",
    "    boken, or for a real challenge, d3 on its own. Interactive data analysis opens the doors for \n",
    "    others to easily interpret your work and explore the data themselves!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Submission:**\n",
    "   - Completed code (`.py` or `.ipynb` file) and results (`.pdf` or `html` file) over Slack DM to instructor. \n",
    "    Please compress multiple files into a single zip file for submission. \n",
    "    In most cases we will not have access to your data and it is important for you to \n",
    "     share your results in a format that persists. \n",
    "    It is easy to download a completed IPython notebook with plots as a pdf or html file."
